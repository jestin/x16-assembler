# X16 Assembler

This is an attempt at writing a simple 65C02 assembler and linker that can be
run on the Commander X16.  It will hopefully be able to be used in conjunction
with X16 Edit, which is already included in the ROM and has a dedicated BASIC
command for running.  If this project gets off the ground and can be ported
into the X16 ROM, then assembly programs can be written on the X16 with no
additional software.

The goal of this project is not to be a fully-featured assembler and linker,
but to provide a way to write assembly directly on the Commander X16.  If
possible, it can be improved and expanded on such that it becomes a tool in a
larger compiler toolchain which might allow for writing C or Prog8 directly on
the Commander X16.
